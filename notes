Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js". Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side.

Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. React is a JavaScript library that is traditionally used to build web applications rendered in the client's browser with JavaScript.

Next.js was first released as an open-source project on GitHub on October 25, 2016; 5 years ago.It was originally developed based on six principles: out-of-the box functionality requiring no setup, JavaScript everywhere, all functions are written in JavaScript, automatic code-splitting and server-rendering, configurable data-fetching, anticipating requests, and simplifying deployment

Created by Vercel, a cloud company for hosting frontends and serverless functions, Next.js is a React framework capable of creating applications that run both on the client and the server, otherwise known as Universal JavaScript applications. This framework helps you build universal apps faster by streamlining basic features like client-side routing and page layout while simplifying advance features like server-side rendering and code splitting.

Next.js, created by Vercel, is a framework for hybrid React applications. It is often difficult to understand all the different ways you might load content. Next.js abstracts this to make it as easy as possible. The framework allows you to build scalable, performant React code and comes with a zero-config approach. This allows developers to focus on building features.

## Introducting the app we are going to build

In this tutorial, we’ll create an app for coordinating social events. In the process, you’ll see how simple it can be to create a web application powered by Next.js and hosted on Vercel. The tutorial will also demonstrate how quickly we can create a fully-fledged relational database on the cloud without installing it locally.

Our simple Next.js web app has:

    An input page that allows a user to add an event with a date, time, title, and description

    An events page that lists all of the events in the database, and that allows a user to respond with their name

    An RSVP list that displays who has responded to the events page

For this tutorial, you should already be familiar with JavaScript. It’s okay if you’re not familiar with the other tools used here, Next.js and CockroachDB, as the tutorial begins with an introduction to them! To follow along, check out the full project code.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve seen how it’s easy to create a web application powered by Next.js and hosted on Vercel. We’ve also shown how quickly we can create a fully-fledged relational database on the cloud without installing it locally. Here is my repo, it’s deployed at: https://social-events-app.vercel.app/
